Today I remembered: math is not my forte.

Part one was rather simple. Sort, count differences, done.

Part two was a mess. I chose to compress the array of adapters by counting the groups of ones and ignoring jumps of 3 as they must appear on every combination. Then I just had to multiply together each group's total number of combinations. Counting those took me more time than I'm ready to admit.

Then somebody clever noticed that each group of ones had a combination equal to the tribonacci values of that rank. I plan to change my hard-coded switch to this.
